          <h1>Protfolio Website -</h1>
          <p>"Welcome to my personal portfolio website, built from scratch using the core technologies of the web: HTML,
            CSS, and JavaScript. This project showcases my skills and experience as a web developer and designer, with a
            focus on creating a visually appealing and interactive user experience.<br>

            <span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML">HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)</a></span> forms the
            structural foundation of my website, providing a semantic and organized framework for my content.<br>

            <span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS">CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)</a></span> brings my website
            to life with custom styling, layout, and visual effects, ensuring a responsive and engaging design that
            adapts to various devices and screen sizes.<br>

            <span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript">JavaScript </a></span> adds dynamic functionality
            and interactivity to my website, enabling features like animations, scrolling effects, and user-friendly
            interfaces.<br>

            Through this project, I demonstrate my proficiency in these essential web development technologies and my
            ability to craft a compelling online presence. Explore my website to learn more about my work, skills, and
            experiences."

          <h3>IDE -</h3>

          <p><span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Studio">Visual Studio Code (VS Code)</a></span> as my
            Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for writing, debugging, and optimizing my code
            With VS Code, I was able to leverage its powerful features such as syntax highlighting, code completion, and
            version control to streamline my development process. The extensions I used, including Live Server and
            Debugger for Chrome, allowed me to preview and test my website in real-time, ensuring a seamless user
            experience.<br>

            Through this project, I demonstrate my proficiency in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as my ability to
            effectively utilize a modern IDE like VS Code. Explore my website to learn more about my work, skills, and
            experiences, and see the technologies in action!"
